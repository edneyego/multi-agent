# Multi-Agent System Workspace

This repository now contains two runnable client apps to interact with the servers using their native protocols:

- apps/a2a-client: JSON-RPC (A2A) client to talk to the A2A server (/.well-known/agent.json, /a2a)
- apps/mcp-client: fastMCP client to talk to MCP servers (weather_server, information_server)

Run each client independently in its own terminal. See individual READMEs inside each folder.
